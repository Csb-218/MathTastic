## Roadmap for Improvement

- Addition of more games 

- Scale difficulty for advanced students (multiple numbers, larger values, time challenges)

- Build adaptive difficulty that responds to player performance

- Advanced features for Activity Builder such a s setting difficulty and progression

- Containerization using Docker
