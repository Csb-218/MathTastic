# Balance Scale Game Backend

Welcome to the backend API for the **Balance Scale Game**, a robust FastAPI-powered service designed to support an educational game where players balance scales using a limited set of weights. This backend handles game logic, user authentication, and data management, providing a scalable foundation for the gameâ€™s frontend.

## About
This FastAPI backend powers the Balance Scale Game, an interactive tool for teaching addition and problem-solving. It provides RESTful APIs to manage game states, authenticate users, and store progress, built with scalability and security in mind. The backend is designed to integrate with a frontend (e.g., Vue.js) and can be deployed on platforms like Render.com.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: JWT-based authentication for secure user sessions.
- **Game Logic API**: Endpoints to calculate balance solutions with up to two weights.
- **Database Integration**: Supports PostgreSQL for storing user data and game progress.
- **Environment Configuration**: Uses `.env` files for environment-specific settings (dev, prod, test).
- **API Documentation**: Automatic Swagger UI and ReDoc via FastAPI.
- **Testing**: Includes Pytest for unit and integration tests.
- **Deployment Ready**: Configured with Docker for production deployment.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Docker (for containerized deployment)
- Git
